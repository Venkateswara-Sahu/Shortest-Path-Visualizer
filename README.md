# Shortest-Path-Visualizer
This Python script is a visualization of the A* (A-star) pathfinding algorithm using the Pygame library, which helps create a graphical interface for visualizing the shortest path in a grid-based system. The A* algorithm is one of the most efficient ways to find the shortest path between two points on a graph while avoiding obstacles or barriers.
